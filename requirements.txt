# This is a frontend-only web application.
# All runtime dependencies (React, DuckDB, etc.) are loaded via a CDN in the index.html file.
# This file is included for project context and to help with local development.

# To serve the static files, you can use Python's built-in web server,
# which requires no external packages. From the project root, run:
#
# python3 -m http.server
#
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

# If you prefer to use a more robust server for development, you could use Flask.
# In that case, you would uncomment the line below and install it via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
#
# flask
